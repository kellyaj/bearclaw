A work in progress for tracking deliveries. Currently only supports FedEx. Named after the character from the classic western film [Jeremiah Johnson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Johnson_(film). To be used in conjunction with my Chrome extension named [trap](https://github.com/kellyaj/trap), another work in progress. 

Requirements
-----------------------
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/)

Setup
-----------------------
The root directory will need a file named `numbers.csv`, but the name can be changed in the `PackMule` class.

Tests

Using unittest and running them via pytest using `py.test -v`
